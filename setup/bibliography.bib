abstract = {The observation that the activity of multiple muscles can be well approximated by a few linear synergies is viewed by some as a sign that such low-dimensionalmodules constitute a key component of the neural control system. Here, we argue that the usefulness of muscle synergies as a control principle should be evaluated in terms of errors produced not only in muscle space, but also in task space. We used data from a force-aiming task in two dimensions at the wrist, using an electromyograms (EMG)-driven virtual biomechanics technique that overcomes typical errors in predicting force from recorded EMG, to illustrate through simulation how synergy decomposition inevitably introduces substantial task space errors. Then,we computed the optimal pattern ofmuscle activation that minimizes summed-squared muscle activities, and demonstrated that synergy decomposition produced similar results on real and simulated data. We further assessed the influence of synergy decomposition on aiming errors (AEs) in a more redundant system, using the optimal muscle pattern computed for the elbow-joint complex (i.e., 13 muscles acting in two dimensions). Because EMG records are typically not available from all contributing muscles, we also explored reconstructions from incomplete sets of muscles. The redundancy of a given set of muscles had opposite effects on the goodness of muscle reconstruction and on task achievement; higher redundancy is associated with better EMG approximation (lower residuals), but with higher AEs. Finally, we showed that the number of synergies required to approximate the optimal muscle pattern for an arbitrary biomechanical system increases with task-space dimensionality, which indicates that the capacity of synergy decomposition to explain behavior depends critically on the scope of the original database. These results have implications regarding the viability of muscle synergy as a putative neural controlmechanism, and also as a control algorithm to restore movements.},

@article{Halaki2012,
abstract = {Electromyography (EMG) has been around since the 1600s [1]. It is a tool used to measure the action potentials of motor units in muscles [2]. The EMG electrodes are like little microphones which “listen” for muscle action potentials so having these microphones in different locations relative to the muscle or motor units affects the nature of the recording [3]. The amplitude and frequency characteristics of the raw electromyogram signal have been shown to be highly variable and sensitive to many factors. De Luca [4] provided a detailed account of these characteristics which have a “basic” or “elemental” effect on the signal dividing them into extrinsic and intrinsic sub-factors. Extrinsic factors are those which can be influenced by the experimenter, and include: electrode configuration (distance between electrodes as well as area and shape of the electrodes); electrode placement with respect to the motor points in the muscle and lateral edge of the muscle as well as the orientation to the muscle fibres; skin preparation and impedance [5, 6]; and perspiration and temperature [7]. Intrinsic factors include: physiological, anatomical and biochemical characteristics of the muscles such as the number of active motor units; fiber type composition of the muscles; blood flow in the muscle; muscle fiber diameter; the distance between the active fibers within the muscle with respect to the electrode; and the amount of tissue between the surface of the muscle and the electrode. These factors vary between individuals, between days within an individual and within a day in an individual if the electrode set up has been altered. Given that there are many factors that influence the EMG signal, voltage recorded from a muscle is difficult to describe in terms of level if there is no reference value to which it can be compared. Therefore, interpretation of the amplitude of the raw EMG signal is problematic unless some kind of normalization procedure is performed. Normalization refers to the conversion of the signal to a scale relative to a known and repeatable value. It has been reported [8] that normalized EMG signals were first presented by Eberhart, Inman {\&} Bresler in 1954 [9]. Since then, there have been a number of methods used to normalize EMG signals with no consensus as to which method is most},

abstract = {How the CNS selects the appropriate muscle patterns to achieve a behavioral goal is an open question. To gain insight into this process, we characterized the spatiotemporal organization of the muscle patterns for fast-reaching movements. We recorded electromyographic activity from up to 19 shoulder and arm muscles during point-to-point movements between a central location and 8 peripheral targets in each of 2 vertical planes. We used an optimization algorithm to identify a set of time-varying muscle synergies, i.e., the coordinated activations of groups of muscles with specific time-varying profiles. For each one of nine subjects, we extracted four or five synergies whose combinations, after scaling in amplitude and shifting in time each synergy independently for each movement condition, explained 73-82{\{}{\%}{\}} of the data variation. We then tested whether these synergies could reconstruct the muscle patterns for point-to-point movements with different loads or forearm postures and for reversal and via-point movements. We found that reconstruction accuracy remained high, indicating generalization across these conditions. Finally, the synergy amplitude coefficients were directionally tuned according to a cosine function with a preferred direction that showed a smaller variability with changes of load, posture, and endpoint than the preferred direction of individual muscles. Thus the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of the muscles patterns for reaching were captured by the combinations of a small number of components, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in the generation of the muscle patterns exploit this low dimensionality to simplify control.},

Nervous stimuli and muscle contractions can be detected by measuring the ionic current flow in the body. This is accomplished using a biopotential electrode. A negatively charged ion is an anion and a positively charged ion is a cation. The current flow in the human body is due to ion flow, not electrons. A biopotential electrode is a transducer that senses ion distribution on the surface of tissue, and converts the ion current to electron current. An electrolyte solution/jelly is placed on the side of the electrode that comes into contact with tissue; the other side of the electrode consists of conductive metal attached to a lead wire connected to the instrument. A chemical reaction occurs at the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode.},

abstract = {—Most myoelectric controlled systems are based on the common assumption that there is no information in the instantaneous value of the myoelectric signal and therefore, analysis is made on the steady state of the muscle contraction. However, this control scheme faces two main drawbacks: users need to be trained in order to produce the sustained contractions, and the control signal can only be generated until the steady state is reached. Prosthetic devices with long actuating delays often result in users' frustration and eventually, in the abandonment of the devices. As a proposed solution, analysis of the transient state of the electromyography (EMG) signal would allow classifying movements during the dynamic part of the muscle contractions reducing the time required to generate control commands. This paper proposes a novel method for transient EMG classification based on the use of Hjorth's parameters. Surface multichannel EMG signals were recorded from 10 normally limbed subjects for both the transient and steady EMG states while performing six different hand motions. Comparatively high classification accuracy was obtained from the transient state analysis of the signals suggesting the existence of deterministic information in this part of the muscle contraction and the fact that Hjorth's parameters seem to adapt well enough to the nature of myoelectric signals as to allow extracting highly representative information from them.},

The current study investigates the usability of intramuscular EMG in two degree-of-freedom using a Fitts' Law approach by combining classification and proportional control to perform a task, with real time feedback of user performance. Nine able-bodied subjects participated in the study. Intramuscular and surface EMG signals were recorded concurrently from the right forearm. Five performance metrics (Throughput, Path efficiency, Average Speed, Overshoot and Completion Rate) were used for quantification of usability. Intramuscular EMG based control performed significantly better than surface EMG for Path Efficiency (80.5 ± 2.4{\%} vs. 71.5 ± 3.8{\%}, P= 0.004) and Overshoot (22.0 ± 3.0{\%} vs. 45.1 ± 6.6{\%}, P= 0.01).

abstract = {In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the relationship between the accuracy of the mapping between EMG and hand kinematics and the control performance in goal-oriented tasks of three simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control algorithms: nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), linear regression (LR), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The purpose was to investigate the impact of the precision of the kinematics estimation by a myoelectric controller for accurately complete goal-directed tasks. Nine na{\"{i}}ve subjects performed a series of goal-directed myoelectric control tasks using the three algorithms, and their online performance was characterized by 6 indexes. The results showed that, although the three algorithms' mapping accuracies were significantly different, their online performance was similar. Moreover, for LR and ANN, the offline performance was not correlated to any of the online performance indexes, and only a weak correlation was found with three of them for NMF . We conclude that for reliable simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control, it is not necessary to achieve high accuracy in the mapping between EMG and kinematics. Rather, good online myoelectric control is achieved by the continuous interaction and adaptation of the user with the myoelectric controller through feedback (visual in the current study). Control signals generated by EMG with rather poor association with kinematic variables can still be fully exploited by the user for precise control. This conclusion explains the possibility of accurate simultaneous and proportional control over multiple degrees of freedom when using unsupervised algorithms, such as NMF.},

The difference between the constrained nature in which such data are often collected and the unpredictable nature of prosthetic use is an example of the semantic gap between research findings and a viable clinical implementation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the variations in limb position associated with normal use can have a substantial impact on the robustness of EMG pattern recognition, as illustrated by an increase in average classification error from 3.8{\%} to 18{\%}. We propose to solve this problem by: 1) collecting EMG data and training the classifier in multiple limb positions and by 2) measuring the limb position with accelerometers. Applying these two methods to data from ten normally limbed subjects, we reduce the average classification error from 18{\%} to 5.7{\%} and 5.0{\%}, respectively. Our study shows how sensor fusion (using EMG and accelerometers) may be an efficient method to mitigate the effect of limb position and improve classification accuracy.},

It builds upon the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), and incorporates subsequent new findings of research. As a component of the fifth assessment cycle, the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) is an important basis for information on changing weather and climate extremes. This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) follows the structure of the Working Group I report. The narrative is supported by a series of overarching highlighted conclusions which, taken together, provide a concise summary. Main sections are introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the methodological basis of the assessment. The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain). Confidence in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement1. Probabilistic estimates of quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding are based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgment2. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. (See Chapter 1 and Box TS.1 for more details about the specific language the IPCC uses to communicate uncertainty) The basis for substantive paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers can be found in the chapter sections of the underlying report and in the Technical Summary.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Unreliability of surface EMG recordings over time is a challenge for applying the EMG pattern recognition (PR)-controlled prostheses in clinical practice. Our previous study proposed a sensor fault-tolerant module (SFTM) by utilizing redundant information in multiple EMG signals. The SFTM consists of multiple sensor fault detectors and a self-recovery mechanism that can identify anomaly in EMG signals and remove the recordings of the disturbed signals from the input of the pattern classifier to recover the PR performance. While the proposed SFTM has shown great promise, the previous design is impractical. A practical SFTM has to be fast enough, lightweight, automatic, and robust under different conditions with or without disturbances.METHODS:This paper presented a real-time, practical SFTM towards robust EMG PR. A novel fast LDA retraining algorithm and a fully automatic sensor fault detector based on outlier detection were developed, which allowed the SFTM to promptly detect disturbances and recover the PR performance immediately. These components of SFTM were then integrated with the EMG PR module and tested on five able-bodied subjects and a transradial amputee in real-time for classifying multiple hand and wrist motions under different conditions with different disturbance types and levels.RESULTS:The proposed fast LDA retraining algorithm significantly shortened the retraining time from nearly 1s to less than 4ms when tested on the embedded system prototype, which demonstrated the feasibility of a nearly "zero-delay" SFTM that is imperceptible to the users. The results of the real-time tests suggested that the SFTM was able to handle different types of disturbances investigated in this study and significantly improve the classification performance when one or multiple EMG signals were disturbed. In addition, the SFTM could also maintain the system's classification performance when there was no disturbance.CONCLUSIONS:This paper presented a real-time, lightweight, and automatic SFTM, which paved the way for reliable and robust EMG PR for prosthesis control.},

abstract = {This paper presents two methods for the classification of six different hand motions based on the analysis of the transient state of surface multichannel electromyographic signals recorded from 10 normally limbed subjects. The signals were classified using the coefficients extracted from a discrete wavelet transform analysis. While the first method uses a feature vector based on the variance of the wavelet coefficients, the second analysis considers a PCA treatment focused on dimensionality reduction. These vectors were used to feed an artificial neural network. The first method was applied for both the transient and steady states obtaining an average classification accuracy of 89.43{\%} (SD 2.05{\%}) and 91.86{\%} (SD 3.17{\%}) respectively. The second method gave a classification accuracy of 92.58{\%} (SD 3.07{\%}) for the transient state. This proves the existence of deterministic information within the transient state of the EMG signal and the possibility to classify different movements since the beginning of the muscle contraction.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinically available prostheses for transradial amputees do not allow simultaneous myoelectric control of degrees of freedom (DOFs). Linear regression methods can provide simultaneous myoelectric control, but frequently also result in difficulty with isolating individual DOFs when desired. This study evaluated the potential of using probabilistic estimates of categories of gross prosthesis movement, which are commonly used in classification-based myoelectric control, to enhance linear regression myoelectric control.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAPPROACH: Gaussian models were fit to electromyogram (EMG) feature distributions for three movement classes at each DOF (no movement, or movement in either direction) and used to weight the output of linear regression models by the probability that the user intended the movement. Eight able-bodied and two transradial amputee subjects worked in a virtual Fitts' law task to evaluate differences in controllability between linear regression and probability-weighted regression for an intramuscular EMG-based three-DOF wrist and hand system.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: Real-time and offline analyses in able-bodied subjects demonstrated that probability weighting improved performance during single-DOF tasks (p {\textless} 0.05) by preventing extraneous movement at additional DOFs. Similar results were seen in experiments with two transradial amputees. Though goodness-of-fit evaluations suggested that the EMG feature distributions showed some deviations from the Gaussian, equal-covariance assumptions used in this experiment, the assumptions were sufficiently met to provide improved performance compared to linear regression control.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: Use of probability weights can improve the ability to isolate individual during linear regression myoelectric control, while maintaining the ability to simultaneously control multiple DOFs.},

abstract = {Electromyography is often used to infer the pattern of production of force by skeletal muscles. The interpretation of muscle function from the electromyogram (EMG) is challenged by the fact that factors such as type of muscle fiber, muscle length, and muscle velocity can all influence the relationship between electrical and mechanical activity of a muscle. Simultaneous measurements of EMG, muscle force, and fascicle length in hindlimb muscles of wild turkeys allow us to probe the quantitative link between force and EMG. We examined two features of the force-EMG relationship. First, we measured the relaxation electromechanical delay (r-EMD) as the time from the end of the EMG signal to time of the end of force. This delay varied with locomotor speed in the lateral gastrocnemius (LG); it was longer at slow walking speeds than for running. This variation in r-EMD was not explained by differences in muscle length trajectory, as the magnitude of r-EMD was not correlated with the velocity of shortening of the muscle during relaxation. We speculate that the longer relaxation times at slow walking speeds compared with running may reflect the longer time course of relaxation in slower muscles fibers. We also examined the relationship between magnitude of force and EMG across a range of walking and running speeds. We analyzed the force-EMG relationship during the swing phase separately from the force-EMG relationship during stance phase. During stance, force amplitude (average force) was linearly related to mean EMG amplitude (average EMG). Forces during swing phase were lower than predicted from the stance phase force-EMG relationship. The different force-EMG relationships during the stance and swing phases may reflect the contribution of passive structures to the development of force, or a nonlinear force-EMG relationship at low levels of muscle activity. Together the results suggest that any inference of force from EMG must be done cautiously when a broad range of activities is considered.},

abstract = {Transhumeral amputation has a significant effect on a person's independence and quality of life. Myoelectric prostheses have the potential to restore upper limb function, however their use is currently limited due to lack of intuitive and natural control of multiple degrees of freedom. The goal of this study was to evaluate a novel transhumeral prosthesis controller that uses a combination of kinematic and electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from the person's proximal humerus. Specifically, we trained a time-delayed artificial neural network to predict elbow flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination from six proximal EMG signals, and humeral angular velocity and linear acceleration. We evaluated this scheme with ten able-bodied subjects offline, as well as in a target-reaching task presented in an immersive virtual reality environment. The offline training had a target of 4?? for flexion/extension and 8?? for pronation/supination, which it easily exceeded (2.7?? and 5.5?? respectively). During online testing, all subjects completed the target-reaching task with path efficiency of 78{\%} and minimal overshoot (1.5{\%}). Thus, combining kinematic and muscle activity signals from the proximal humerus can provide adequate prosthesis control, and testing in a virtual reality environment can provide meaningful data on controller performance.},

abstract = {Abstract—In recent years, many sophisticated control strate- gies for multifunctional dexterous hand prostheses have been developed. It was indeed assumed that control mechanisms based on switching between degrees of freedom, which are in use since the 1960's, could not be extended to efficient control of more than two degrees of freedom. However, quantitative proof for this assumption has not been shown. In this study, we adopted the mode switching paradigm available in commercial prostheses for two degree of freedom control and we extended it for the control of seven functions (3.5 degrees of freedom) in a modern robotic hand. We compared the controllability of this scaled version of the standard method to a state of the art pattern recognition based control in an applied online study. The aim was to quantify whether multi-functional prosthetic control with mode switching outperformed pattern recognition in the control of a real prosthetic hand for daily life activities online. Although in simple grasp-release tasks the conventional method performed best, tasks requiring more complex control of multiple degrees of freedom required a more intuitive control method, such as pattern recognition, for achieving high performance.

Three DOFs including wrist flexion-extension, abduction-adduction and forearm pronation-supination were investigated with 10 able-bodied subjects and two individuals with transradial limb deficiency (LD). A Fitts' law test involving real-time target acquisition tasks was conducted to compare the usability of the SVM-based control system to that of an artificial neural network (ANN) based method. Performance was assessed using the Fitts' law throughput value as well as additional metrics including completion rate, path efficiency and overshoot. The SVM-based approach outperformed the ANN-based system in every performance measure for able-bodied subjects. The SVM outperformed the ANN in path efficiency and throughput with the first LD subject and in throughput with the second LD subject. The superior performance of the SVM-based system appears to be due to its higher estimation accuracy of all DOFs during inactive and low amplitude segments (these periods were frequent during real-time control). Another advantage of the SVM-based method was that it substantially reduced the processing time for both training and real time control.},

To be successful in classification of the EMG signal, selection of a feature vector ought to be carefully considered. However, numerous studies of the EMG signal classification have used a feature set that have contained a number of redundant features. In this study, most complete and up-to-date thirty-seven time domain and frequency domain features have been proposed to be studied their properties. The results, which were verified by scatter plot of features, statistical analysis and classifier, indicated that most time domain features are superfluity and redundancy. They can be grouped according to mathematical property and information into four main types: energy and complexity, frequency, prediction model, and time-dependence. On the other hand, all frequency domain features are calculated based on statistical parameters of EMG power spectral density. Its performance in class separability viewpoint is not suitable for EMG recognition system. Recommendation of features to avoid the usage of redundant features for classifier in EMG signal classification applications is also proposed in this study. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In recent years the number of active controllable joints in electrically powered hand-prostheses has increased significantly. However, the control strategies for these devices in current clinical use are inadequate as they require separate and sequential control of each degree-of-freedom (DoF). In this study we systematically compare linear and nonlinear regression techniques for an independent, simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control of wrist movements with two DoF. These techniques include linear regression, mixture of linear experts (ME), multilayer-perceptron, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). They are investigated offline with electro-myographic signals acquired from ten able-bodied subjects and one person with congenital upper limb deficiency. The control accuracy is reported as a function of the number of electrodes and the amount and diversity of training data providing guidance for the requirements in clinical practice. The results showed that KRR, a nonparametric statistical learning method, outperformed the other methods. However, simple transformations in the feature space could linearize the problem, so that linear models could achieve similar performance as KRR at much lower computational costs. Especially ME, a physiologically inspired extension of linear regression represents a promising candidate for the next generation of prosthetic devices.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s). Background: Myoelectric pattern recognition systems can decode movement intention to drive upper-limb prostheses. Despite recent advances in academic research, the commercial adoption of such systems remains low. This limitation is mainly due to the lack of classification robustness and a simultaneous requirement for a large number of electromyogram (EMG) electrodes. We propose to address these two issues by using a multi-modal approach which combines surface electromyography (sEMG) with inertial measurements (IMs) and an appropriate training data collection paradigm. We demonstrate that this can significantly improve classification performance as compared to conventional techniques exclusively based on sEMG signals. Methods: We collected and analyzed a large dataset comprising recordings with 20 able-bodied and two amputee participants executing 40 movements. Additionally, we conducted a novel real-time prosthetic hand control experiment with 11 able-bodied subjects and an amputee by using a state-of-the-art commercial prosthetic hand. A systematic performance comparison was carried out to investigate the potential benefit of incorporating IMs in prosthetic hand control. Results: The inclusion of IM data improved performance significantly, by increasing classification accuracy (CA) in the offline analysis and improving completion rates (CRs) in the real-time experiment. Our findings were consistent across able-bodied and amputee subjects. Integrating the sEMG electrodes and IM sensors within a single sensor package enabled us to achieve high-level performance by using on average 4-6 sensors. Conclusions: The results from our experiments suggest that IMs can form an excellent complimentary source signal for upper-limb myoelectric prostheses. We trust that multi-modal control solutions have the potential of improving the usability of upper-extremity prostheses in real-life applications.},

Thus, one purpose of this paper is to suggest an unambiguous taxonomy, applicable to control systems for upper limb prostheses and also to prostheses in general. A functionally partitioned model of the prosthesis control problem is also presented along with the taxonomy. In the second half of the paper, the suggested taxonomy has been exploited in a comprehensive literature review on proportional myoelectric control of upper limb prostheses. The review revealed that the methods for system training have not matured at the same pace as the novel multifunction prostheses and more advanced intent interpretation methods. Few publications exist regarding the choice of training method and the composition of the training data set. In this context, the notion of outcome measures is essential. By definition, system training involves optimization, and the quality of the results depends heavily on the choice of appropriate optimization criteria.

These factors become more important the more degrees of freedom (DOF) a multifunctional prosthesis provides. Despite the large amount of research efforts during the past decades on developing robust control and feedback methods, there has been limited attention on the importance of the aforementioned human factors on the usability of the prosthesis. Psychometric measures are necessary to get a better view on user-ability in prosthesis control. To achieve this aim, the work presented herein applies Item-Response Theory (IRT), which is a psychometric instrument that has been well established for testing human abilities, to introduce a novel score of user performance. This score can be utilized to judge the user's performance at different stages of training, which means measuring improvement or deterioration in movement muscle control according to training activities. As pattern recognition is the control method of choice, classification-rate is taken as second information on the discrimination and repeatability of the recorded movement related EMG patterns. It is used to update the IRT score by taking the joint probability, which combines both measures to determine then the user performance score in a more meaningful way. The score was calibrated on well-trained, able-bodied subjects, who act as a {\&}{\#}x201C;gold{\&}{\#}x201D; standard when their movement error was below a certain threshold. Then four amputees with different training experience were selected and it was verified that the score could distinguish between them.},

abstract = {The human hand is a complex system, with a large number of degrees of freedom (DoFs), sensors embedded in its structure, actuators and tendons, and a complex hierarchical control. Despite this complexity, the efforts required to the user to carry out the different movements is quite small (albeit after an appropriate and lengthy training). On the contray, prosthetic hands are just a pale replication of the natural hand, with significantly reduced grasping capabilities and no sensory information delivered back to the user. Several attempts have been carried out to develop multifunctional prosthetic devices controlled by electromyographic (EMG) signals (myoelectric hands), harness (kinematic hands), dimensional changes in residual muscles, and so forth, but none ofthese methods permits the "natural" control of more than two DoFs. This article presents a review of the traditional methods used to control artificial hands by means of EMG signal, in both the clinical and research contexts, and introduces what could be the future developments in the control strategy of these devices.},

abstract = {When sharing load among multiple muscles, humans appear to select an optimal pattern of activation that minimizes costs such as the effort or variability of movement. How the nervous system achieves this behavior, however, is unknown. Here we show that contrary to predictions from optimal control theory, habitual muscle activation patterns are surprisingly robust to changes in limb biomechanics. We first developed a method to simulate joint forces in real time from electromyographic recordings of the wrist muscles. When the model was altered to simulate the effects of paralyzing a muscle, the subjects simply increased the recruitment of all muscles to accomplish the task, rather than recruiting only the useful muscles. When the model was altered to make the force output of one muscle unusually noisy, the subjects again persisted in recruiting all muscles rather than eliminating the noisy one. Such habitual coordination patterns were also unaffected by real modifications of biomechanics produced by selectively damaging a muscle without affecting sensory feedback. Subjects naturally use different patterns of muscle contraction to produce the same forces in different pronation-supination postures, but when the simulation was based on a posture different from the actual posture, the recruitment patterns tended to agree with the actual rather than the simulated posture. The results appear inconsistent with computation of motor programs by an optimal controller in the brain. Rather, the brain may learn and recall command programs that result in muscle coordination patterns generated by lower sensorimotor circuitry that are functionally "good-enough."},
annote = {source [33] from high-density EMG

the brain recruits muscles to perform different tasks. If key muscles are excluded to perform a movement (by paralysis) they are normally a mayor contributor to, the brain will recruit other muscles to achieve the wanted movement, regardless of the parapysed muscle. It is unknown how the brain does this, but the method seems to function on a "good-enough" basis.

no matter how used to body is to doing a specific task, it will immediatly change the normal muscle recruitment to one that will enable to body to do the task},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Closing the loop in myoelectric prostheses by providing artificial somatosensory feedback to the user is an important need for prosthetic users. Previous studies investigated feedback strategies in combination with the control of one degree of freedom of simple grippers. Modern hands, however, are sophisticated multifunction systems. In this study, we assessed multichannel electrotactile feedback integrated with an advanced method for the simultaneous and proportional control of individual fingers of a dexterous hand. APPROACH The feedback used spatial and frequency coding to provide information on the finger positions (normalized flexion angles). A comprehensive set of conditions have been investigated in 28 able-bodied subjects, including feedback modalities (visual, electrotactile and no feedback), control tasks (fingers and grasps), systems (virtual and real hand), control methods (ideal and realistic) and range of motion (low and high). The task for the subjects was to operate the hand using closed-loop myoelectric control and generate the desired movement (e.g., selected finger or grasp at a specific level of closure). MAIN RESULTS The subjects could perceive the multichannel and multivariable electrotactile feedback and effectively exploit it to improve the control performance with respect to open-loop grasping. The improvement however depended on the reliability of the feedforward control, with less consistent control exhibiting performance trends that were more complex across the conditions. SIGNIFICANCE The results are promising for the potential application of advanced feedback to close the control loop in sophisticated prosthetic systems.},

The algorithm is based on a generative model for the surface EMG. The model assumes that synergistic muscles share spinal neural drives, which correspond to the intended activations of different DOFs of natural movements and are embedded within the surface EMG. A DOF-wise nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is developed to estimate neural control information from the multichannel surface EMG. It is shown, both by simulation and experimental studies, that the proposed algorithm is able to extract the multidimensional control information simultaneously. A direct application of the proposed method would be providing simultaneous and proportional control of multifunction myoelectric prostheses.},

abstract = {Abstract--It is proposed that myo-electric signals can be used to augment conven- tional speech-recognition systems to improve their performance under acoustically noisy conditions (e.g. in an aircraft cockpit). A preliminary study is performed to ascertain the presence of speech information within myo-e/ectric signals from facial muscles. Five surface myo-e/ectric signals are recorded during speech, using Ag- AgCI button electrodes embedded in a pilot oxygen mask. An acoustic channel is also recorded to enable segmentation of the recorded myo-electric signal These segments are processed off-line, using a wavelet transform feature set, and classified with linear discriminant analysis. Two experiments are performed, using a ten-word vocabulary consisting of the numbers "zero" to "nine" Five subjects are tested in the first experiment, where the vocabulary is not randomised. Subjects repeat each word continuously for l min; classification errors range from 0.0{\%} to 6.1{\%}. Two of the subjects perform the second experiment, saying words from the vocabulary randomly; classification errors are 2.7{\%} and 10.4{\%}. The results demonstrate that there is excellent potential for using surface myo-electric signals to enhance the performance of a conventional speech-recognition system.},

A large portion of the literature focuses on offline classification accuracy of pre-recorded signals. Historically, however, there has been a semantic gap between research findings and a clinically viable implementation. Recently, renewed focus on prosthetics research has pushed the field to provide more clinically relevant outcomes. One way to work towards this goal is to examine the differences between research and clinical results. The constrained nature in which offline training and test data is often collected compared to the dynamic nature of prosthetic use is just one example. In this work, we demonstrate that variations in limb position after training can have a substantial impact on the robustness of myoelectric pattern recognition.},

abstract = {Myoelectric control has been extensively applied in multi-function hand/wrist prostheses. The performance of this type of control is however, influenced by several practical factors that still limit its clinical applicability. One of these factors is the change in arm posture during the daily use of prostheses. In this study, we investigate the effect of arm position on the performance of a simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control algorithm, both on trans-radial amputees and able-bodied subjects. The results showed that changing arm position adversely influences the performance of the algorithm for both subject groups, but that this influence is less pronounced in amputee subjects with respect to able-bodied subjects. Thus, the impact of arm posture on myoelectric control cannot be inferred from results on able-bodied subjects and should be directly investigated in amputee subjects.},

abstract = {Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of electromyography (EMG) data, in combination with a diverse array of mechanical sensors, to locomotion mode intent recognition in transfemoral amputees using powered prostheses. Additionally, we determined the effect of adding time history information using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for both the mechanical and EMG sensors. Approach. EMG signals from the residual limbs of amputees have been proposed to enhance pattern recognition-based intent recognition systems for powered lower limb prostheses, but mechanical sensors on the prosthesis-such as inertial measurement units, position and velocity sensors, and load cells-may be just as useful. EMG and mechanical sensor data were collected from 8 transfemoral amputees using a powered knee/ankle prosthesis over basic locomotion modes such as walking, slopes and stairs. An offline study was conducted to determine the benefit of different sensor sets for predicting intent. Main results. EMG information was not as accurate alone as mechanical sensor information (p {\textless} 0.05) for any classification strategy. However, EMG in combination with the mechanical sensor data did significantly reduce intent recognition errors (p {\textless} 0.05) both for transitions between locomotion modes and steady-state locomotion. The sensor time history (DBN) classifier significantly reduced error rates compared to a linear discriminant classifier for steady-state steps, without increasing the transitional error, for both EMG and mechanical sensors. Combining EMG and mechanical sensor data with sensor time history reduced the average transitional error from 18.4{\%} to 12.2{\%} and the average steady-state error from 3.8{\%} to 1.0{\%} when classifying level-ground walking, ramps, and stairs in eight transfemoral amputee subjects. Significance. These results suggest that a neural interface in combination with time history methods for locomotion mode classification can enhance intent recognition performance; this strategy should be considered for future real-time experiments.},
