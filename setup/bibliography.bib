abstract = {Care of veterans and servicemembers with major traumatic limb loss from combat theaters is one of the highest priorities of the Department of Veteran Affairs. We achieved a 62{\%} response rate in our Survey for Prosthetic Use from 298 Vietnam war veterans and 283 servicemembers/veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) who sustained major traumatic limb loss. Participants reported their combat injuries; health status; quality of life; and prosthetic device use, function, rejection, and satisfaction. Despite the serious injuries experienced, health status was rated excellent, very good, or good by 70.7{\%} of Vietnam war and 85.5{\%} of OIF/OEF survey participants. However, many health issues persist for Vietnam war and OIF/OEF survey participants (respectively): phantom limb pain (72.2{\%}/76.0{\%}), chronic back pain (36.2{\%}/42.1{\%}), residual-limb pain (48.3{\%}/62.9{\%}), prosthesis-related skin problems (51.0{\%}/58.0{\%}), hearing loss (47.0{\%}/47.0{\%}), traumatic brain injury (3.4{\%}/33.9{\%}), depression (24.5{\%}/24.0{\%}), and posttraumatic stress disorder (37.6{\%}/58.7{\%}). Prosthetic devices are currently used by 78.2{\%} of Vietnam war and 90.5{\%} of OIF/OEF survey participants to improve function and mobility. On average, the annual rate for prosthetic device receipt is 10.7-fold higher for OIF/OEF than for Vietnam war survey participants. Findings from this cross-conflict survey identify many strengths in prosthetic rehabilitation for those with limb loss and several areas for future attention.},

abstract = {The Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) considers new evidence of climate change based on many independent scientific analyses from observations of the climate system, paleoclimate archives, theoretical studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models. It builds upon the Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), and incorporates subsequent new findings of research. As a component of the fifth assessment cycle, the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) is an important basis for information on changing weather and climate extremes. This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) follows the structure of the Working Group I report. The narrative is supported by a series of overarching highlighted conclusions which, taken together, provide a concise summary. Main sections are introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the methodological basis of the assessment. The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain). Confidence in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement1. Probabilistic estimates of quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding are based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgment2. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. (See Chapter 1 and Box TS.1 for more details about the specific language the IPCC uses to communicate uncertainty) The basis for substantive paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers can be found in the chapter sections of the underlying report and in the Technical Summary.

abstract = {Previous studies on intramuscular EMG based control used offline data analysis. The current study investigates the usability of intramuscular EMG in two degree-of-freedom using a Fitts' Law approach by combining classification and proportional control to perform a task, with real time feedback of user performance. Nine able-bodied subjects participated in the study. Intramuscular and surface EMG signals were recorded concurrently from the right forearm. Five performance metrics (Throughput, Path efficiency, Average Speed, Overshoot and Completion Rate) were used for quantification of usability. Intramuscular EMG based control performed significantly better than surface EMG for Path Efficiency (80.5 ± 2.4{\%} vs. 71.5 ± 3.8{\%}, P= 0.004) and Overshoot (22.0 ± 3.0{\%} vs. 45.1 ± 6.6{\%}, P= 0.01). No difference was found between Throughput and Completion Rate. However the Average Speed was significantly higher for surface (51.8 ± 5.5{\%}) than for intramuscular EMG (35.7 ± 2.7{\%}). The results obtained in this study imply that intramuscular EMG has great potential as control source for advanced myoelectric prosthetic devices. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

More generally, however, such a controller can be applied to simultaneously control any 2 DOF's under a direct, proportional control scheme. There is no generally accepted method to objectively and quantitatively evaluate prosthesis and prosthesis control performance, and the second goal of this study was to develop one based on Fitts Law.

abstract = { Abstract—In recent years, low-cost, low-power myoelectric control systems such as the Myo armband from Thalmic Labs have become available and unlocked tremendous possibilities for myoelectric controlled applications. However, due to the embedded system constraints, such sEMG control devices typically samples sEMG signals at a lower frequency. It is in doubt whether existing sEMG feature extraction methods are still valid on such low-resolution sEMG data. In addition, the feature extraction algorithms implemented on embedded devices must have low computational complexity in order to meet the real-time requirement. This paper aims to investigate effective features for low-resolution EMG pattern recognition. In particular, a set of novel computational efficient space-domain (SD) features (referred to as simple SD (SSD) features) have been developed to exploit the spatial relationships of sEMG signals recorded from the sensor array on the Myo armband. The proposed SSD feature set was evaluated with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based classifier on a 9-gesture dataset. The experimental results indicate that using the SSD features increased the classification accuracy by 5{\%} compared to using Hudgins' time-domain features.},

abstract = {This review presents an analytical and comparative survey of upper limb prosthesis acceptance and abandonment as documented over the past 25 years, detailing areas of consumer dissatisfaction and ongoing technological advancements. English-language articles were identified in a search of Ovid, PubMed, and ISI Web of Science (1980 until February 2006) for key words upper limb and prosthesis. Articles focused on upper limb prostheses and addressing: (i) Factors associated with abandonment; (ii) Rejection rates; (iii) Functional analyses and patterns of wear; and (iv) Consumer satisfaction, were extracted with the exclusion of those detailing tools for outcome measurement, case studies, and medical procedures. Approximately 200 articles were included in the review process with 40 providing rates of prosthesis rejection. Quantitative measures of population characteristics, study methodology, and prostheses in use were extracted from each article. Mean rejection rates of 45{\%} and 35{\%} were observed in the literature for body-powered and electric prostheses respectively in pediatric populations. Significantly lower rates of rejection for both body-powered (26{\%}) and electric (23{\%}) devices were observed in adult populations while the average incidence of non-wear was similar for pediatric (16{\%}) and adult (20{\%}) populations. Documented rates of rejection exhibit a wide range of variance, possibly due to the heterogeneous samples involved and methodological differences between studies. Future research should comprise of controlled, multifactor studies adopting standardized outcome measures in order to promote comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting prosthesis use and abandonment. An enhanced understanding of these factors is needed to optimize prescription practices, guide design efforts, and satiate demand for evidence-based measures of intervention.},

@article{Bruun2017,
abstract = {Abstract — Electromyography (EMG) is widely used for controlling upper limb prosthetics. However, EMG sig- nals for the same movements change with variations in limb position and this lowers the accuracy in con- trol schemes [1]. Most previous studies testing the ef- fect of limb position using classification have found a negative effect in performance. Linear regression is a newer method in control of myoelectric prosthetics, which has proven to yield robust simultaneous and pro- portional control. A novel approach would be to investi- gate the limb position effect with regression models. This study investigated the effect of limb position in a linear regression-based control scheme, when using Mean Ab- solute Value (MAV) and Logarithmic Variance (LogVar) as features. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data was ad- ditionally included to improve the performance of the re- gression models. Twelve able-bodied subjects were re- cruited for data acquisition, performing four wrist move- ments in three limb positions. One regression model was build to recognize the different wrist movements under study, taking into account both features. The regressors were tested online in a virtual environment. The results showed that changes in limb position do not affect the control when using a linear regression model. This is opposed to previous studies using classification as con- trol scheme. Inclusion of IMU data shows no significant improvement in performance. Linear regression has the potential to be used in future control schemes for myo- electric prosthetics in daily life tasks.},

abstract = {A tradeoff exists when considering the delay created by multifunctional prosthesis controllers. Large controller delays maximize the amount of time available for EMG signal collection and analysis (and thus maximize classification accuracy); however, large delays also degrade prosthesis performance by decreasing the responsiveness of the prosthesis. To elucidate an "optimal controller delay" twenty able-bodied subjects performed the Box and Block Test using a device called PHABS (prosthetic hand for able bodied subjects). Tests were conducted with seven different levels of controller delay ranging from nearly 0-300 ms and with two different artificial hand speeds. Based on repeted measures ANOVA analysis and a linear mixed effects model, the optimal controller delay was found to range between approximately 100 ms for fast prehensors and 125 ms for slower prehensors. Furthermore, the linear mixed effects model shows that there is a linear degradation in performance with increasing delay.},

abstract = {The classification of the bio-signal has been used for various purposes in the literature as they are versatile in diagnosis of anomalies, improvement of overall health and sport performance and creating intuitive human computer interfaces. However, automatic identification of the signal patterns on a streaming real-time signal requires a series of complex procedures. A plethora of heuristic methods, such as neural networks and fuzzy systems, have been proposed as a solution. These methods stipulate certain conditions, such as preconditioning the signals, manual feature selection and large number of training samples. In this study, we introduce a novel variant and application of the Collaborative Representation based Classification (CRC) in spectral domain for recognition of hand gestures using raw surface electromyography (EMG) signals. The CRC based methods do not require large number of training samples for an efficient pattern classification. Additionally, we present a training procedure in which a high end subspace clustering method is employed for clustering the representative samples into their corresponding class labels. Thereby, the need for feature extraction and spotting patterns manually on the training samples is obviated. We presented the intuitive use of spectral features via circulant matrices. The proposed Spectral Collaborative Representation based Classification (SCRC) is able to recognize gestures with higher levels of accuracy for a fairly rich gesture set compared to the available methods. The worst recognition result which is the best in the literature is obtained as 97.3{\%} among the four sets of the experiments for each hand gestures. The recognition results are reported with a substantial number of experiments and labeling computation.},

abstract = {This paper represents an ongoing investigation of dexterous and natural control of upper extremity prostheses using the myoelectric signal (MES). The scheme described within uses pattern recognition to process four channels of MES, with the task of discriminating multiple classes of limb movement. The method does not require segmentation of the MES data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. It is shown in this paper that, by exploiting the processing power inherent in current computing systems, substantial gains in classifier accuracy and response time are possible. Other important characteristics for prosthetic control systems are met as well. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. Finally, minimal storage capacity is required, which is an important factor in embedded control systems.},

abstract = {This study describes a novel myoelectric control scheme that is capable of motion rejection. As an extension of the commonly used linear discriminant analysis (LDA), this system generates a confidence score for each decision, providing the ability to reject those with a score below a selected threshold. The thresholds are class-specific and affect only the rejection characteristics of the associated class. Furthermore, because the rejection stage is implemented using the outputs of the LDA, the active motion classification accuracy of the proposed system is shown to outperform that of the LDA for all values of rejection threshold. The proposed scheme was compared to a baseline LDA-based pattern recognition system using a real-time Fitts' law-based target acquisition task. The use of velocity-based myoelectric control using the rejection classifier is shown to obey Fitts' law, producing linear regression fittings with high coefficients of determination (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.943). Significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.001) throughput, path efficiency, and completion rates were observed with the rejection-capable system for both able-bodied and amputee subjects.},

Recently, renewed focus on prosthetics research has pushed the field to provide more clinically relevant outcomes. One way to work towards this goal is to examine the differences between research and clinical results.

abstract = {Pattern recognition control systems have the potential to provide better, more reliable myoelectric prosthesis control for individuals with an upper-limb amputation. However, proper patient training is essential. We begin user training by teaching the concepts of pattern recognition control and progress to teaching how to control, use, and maintain prostheses with one or many degrees of freedom. Here we describe the training stages, with relevant case studies, and highlight several tools that can be used throughout the training process, including prosthesis-guided training (PGT) —a self-initiated, simple method of recalibrating a pattern recognition–controlled prosthesis. PGT may lengthen functional use times, potentially increasing prosthesis wear time. Using this training approach, we anticipate advancing pattern recognition control from the laboratory to the home environment and finally realizing the full potential of these control systems.

Subjects attended eight one-on-one training sessions that focused on improving the consistency and distinguishability of their hand and wrist movements using visual biofeedback from a virtual prosthesis. The virtual environment facilitated the precise quantification of three prosthesis control measures. During a final evaluation, the subject population saw an average increase in movement completion percentage from 70.8{\%} to 99.0{\%}, an average improvement in normalized movement completion time from 1.47 to 1.13, and an average increase in movement classifier accuracy from 77.5{\%} to 94.4{\%} (p{\textless}0.001). Additionally, all four subjects were reevaluated after eight elapsed hours without retraining the classifier, and all subjects demonstrated minimal decreases in performance. Our analysis of the underlying sources of improvement for each subject examined the sizes and separation of high-dimensional data clusters and revealed that each subject formed a unique and effective strategy for improving the consistency and/or distinguishability of his or her phantom limb movements.

abstract = {User acceptance of myoelectric forearm prostheses is currently low. Awkward control, lack of feedback, and difficult training are cited as primary reasons. Recently, researchers have focused on exploiting the new possibilities offered by advancements in prosthetic technology. Alternatively, researchers could focus on prosthesis acceptance by developing functional requirements based on activities users are likely to perform. In this article, we describe the process of determining such requirements and then the application of these requirements to evaluating the state of the art in myoelectric forearm prosthesis research. As part of a needs assessment, a workshop was organized involving clinicians (representing end users), academics, and engineers. The resulting needs included an increased number of functions, lower reaction and execution times, and intuitiveness of both control and feedback systems. Reviewing the state of the art of research in the main prosthetic subsystems (electromyographic [EMG] sensing, control, and feedback) showed that modern research prototypes only partly fulfill the requirements. We found that focus should be on validating EMG-sensing results with patients, improving simultaneous control of wrist movements and grasps, deriving optimal parameters for force and position feedback, and taking into account the psychophysical aspects of feedback, such as intensity perception and spatial acuity.},

abstract = {The recent introduction of novel multifunction hands as well as new control paradigms increase the demand for advanced prosthetic control systems. In this context, an unambiguous terminology and a good understanding of the nature of the control problem is important for efficient research and communication concerning the subject. Thus, one purpose of this paper is to suggest an unambiguous taxonomy, applicable to control systems for upper limb prostheses and also to prostheses in general. A functionally partitioned model of the prosthesis control problem is also presented along with the taxonomy. In the second half of the paper, the suggested taxonomy has been exploited in a comprehensive literature review on proportional myoelectric control of upper limb prostheses. The review revealed that the methods for system training have not matured at the same pace as the novel multifunction prostheses and more advanced intent interpretation methods. Few publications exist regarding the choice of training method and the composition of the training data set. In this context, the notion of outcome measures is essential. By definition, system training involves optimization, and the quality of the results depends heavily on the choice of appropriate optimization criteria. In order to further promote the development of proportional myoelectric control, these topics need to be addressed.},

abstract = {The surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal that originates in the muscle is inevitably contaminated by various noise signals or artifacts that originate at the skin-electrode interface, in the electronics that amplifies the signals, and in external sources. Modern technology is substantially immune to some of these noises, but not to the baseline noise and the movement artifact noise. These noise sources have frequency spectra that contaminate the low-frequency part of the sEMG frequency spectrum. There are many factors which must be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate filter specifications to remove these artifacts; they include the muscle tested and type of contraction, the sensor configuration, and specific noise source. The band-pass determination is always a compromise between (a) reducing noise and artifact contamination, and (b) preserving the desired information from the sEMG signal. This study was designed to investigate the effects of mechanical perturbations and noise that are typically encountered during sEMG recordings in clinical and related applications. The analysis established the relationship between the attenuation rates of the movement artifact and the sEMG signal as a function of the filter band pass. When this relationship is combined with other considerations related to the informational content of the signal, the signal distortion of filters, and the kinds of artifacts evaluated in this study, a Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20. Hz and a slope of 12. dB/oct is recommended for general use. The results of this study are relevant to biomechanical and clinical applications where the measurements of body dynamics and kinematics may include artifact sources. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {When controlling a powered upper limb prosthesis it is important not only to know how to move the device, but also when not to move. A novel approach to pattern recognition control, using a selective multiclass one-versus-one classification scheme has been shown to be capable of rejecting unintended motions. This method was shown to outperform other popular classification schemes when presented with muscle contractions that did not correspond to desired actions. In this work, a three dimensional Fitts Law test is proposed as a suitable alternative to using virtual limb environments for evaluating real-time myoelectric control performance. The test is used to compare the selective approach to a state-of-the-art LDA classification based scheme. The framework is shown to obey Fitts Law for both control schemes, producing linear regression fittings with high coefficients of determination (R2 {\textgreater} 0.936). Additional performance metrics focused on quality of control are discussed and incorporated in the evaluation. Using this framework the selective classification based scheme is shown to produce significantly higher efficiency and completion rates, and significantly lower overshoot and stopping distances, with no significant difference in throughput.},

However, a general consensus upon the PDF of the EMG signals is yet to be reached, because not only are there several biological factors that can influence this distribution function, but also different analysis techniques can lead to contradicting results. Here, we recorded the EMG signal at different isometric muscle contraction levels and characterised the probability distribution of the surface EMG signal with two statistical measures: bicoherence and kurtosis. Bicoherence analysis did not help to infer the PDF of measured EMG signals. In contrast, with kurtosis analysis we demonstrated that the EMG PDF at isometric, non-fatiguing, low contraction levels is super-Gaussian. Moreover, kurtosis analysis showed that as the contraction force increases the surface EMG PDF tends to a Gaussian distribution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition-based control of myoelectric prostheses offers amputees a natural, intuitive way of controlling the increasing functionality of modern myoelectric prostheses. While this approach to prosthesis control is certainly attractive, it is a significant departure from existing control methods. The transition from the more traditional methods of direct or proportional control to pattern recognition-based control presents a training challenge that will be unique to each amputee. In this paper we describe specific ways that a transradial amputee, prosthetist, and occupational therapist team can overcome these challenges by developing consistent and distinguishable muscle patterns. A central part of this process is the employment of a computer-based pattern recognition training system with which an amputee can learn and improve pattern recognition skills throughout the process of prosthesis fitting and testing. We describe in detail the manner in which four transradial amputees trained to improve their pattern recognition-based control of a virtual prosthesis by focusing on building consistent, distinguishable muscle patterns. We also describe a three-phase framework for instruction and training: 1) initial demonstration and conceptual instruction, 2) in-clinic testing and initial training, and 3) at-home training.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. Objective. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and user training (UT) are two types of methods to improve myoelectric control performance for amputees. In this study, we compared the independent effect between tDCS and UT, and investigated the combined effect of tDCS and UT. Approach. An online paradigm of simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) based on electromyography (EMG) was adopted. The proposed experiments were conducted on six na{\"{i}}ve unilateral trans-radial amputees. The subjects each received three types of 20 min interventions: active tDCS with motor training (tDCS + UT), active tDCS with quiet sitting (tDCS), and sham tDCS with motor training (UT). The interventions were applied at one week intervals in a randomized order. The subjects performed online control of a feedback arrow with two degrees of freedom (DoFs) to accomplish target reaching motor tasks in pre-sessions and post-sessions. We compared the performance, measured by completion rate, completion time, and efficiency coefficient, between pre-sessions and post-sessions. Main results. The results showed that the intervention tDCS + UT and tDCS significantly improved the online SPC performance (i.e. improved the completion rate; reduced the completion time; and improved the efficiency coefficient), while intervention UT did not significantly change the performance. The results also showed that the online SPC performance after intervention tDCS + UT and tDCS was not significantly different, but both were significantly better than that after intervention UT. Significance. tDCS could be an effective intervention to improve the online SPC performance in a short time.},

The main intention is to simplify the first steps in the use of EMG as research and evaluation tool and get started. It tries to overview and summarize the basic knowledge needed to apply and perform meaningful EMG setups and concentrates on practical questions and solutions. It is strongly recommended to study the scientific publications and textbooks related to a certain topic. This booklet cannot reflect the variety of different views, opinions and strategies that have to be considered for a responsible scientific use of EMG.},

abstract = {In recent years the number of active controllable joints in electrically powered hand-prostheses has increased significantly. However, the control strategies for these devices in current clinical use are inadequate as they require separate and sequential control of each degree-of-freedom (DoF). In this study we systematically compare linear and nonlinear regression techniques for an independent, simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control of wrist movements with two DoF. These techniques include linear regression, mixture of linear experts (ME), multilayer-perceptron, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). They are investigated offline with electro-myographic signals acquired from ten able-bodied subjects and one person with congenital upper limb deficiency. The control accuracy is reported as a function of the number of electrodes and the amount and diversity of training data providing guidance for the requirements in clinical practice. The results showed that KRR, a nonparametric statistical learning method, outperformed the other methods. However, simple transformations in the feature space could linearize the problem, so that linear models could achieve similar performance as KRR at much lower computational costs. Especially ME, a physiologically inspired extension of linear regression represents a promising candidate for the next generation of prosthetic devices.},

abstract = {Feature extraction is a significant method to extract the useful information which is hidden in surface electromyography (EMG) signal and to remove the unwanted part and interferences. To be successful in classification of the EMG signal, selection of a feature vector ought to be carefully considered. However, numerous studies of the EMG signal classification have used a feature set that have contained a number of redundant features. In this study, most complete and up-to-date thirty-seven time domain and frequency domain features have been proposed to be studied their properties. The results, which were verified by scatter plot of features, statistical analysis and classifier, indicated that most time domain features are superfluity and redundancy. They can be grouped according to mathematical property and information into four main types: energy and complexity, frequency, prediction model, and time-dependence. On the other hand, all frequency domain features are calculated based on statistical parameters of EMG power spectral density. Its performance in class separability viewpoint is not suitable for EMG recognition system. Recommendation of features to avoid the usage of redundant features for classifier in EMG signal classification applications is also proposed in this study. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
