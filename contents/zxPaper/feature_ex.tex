\section{Feature extraction) 
	
To feed the classifier with training data features were extracted from the signal. The signal were segmented into 200 ms windows with a 50\% overlap respecting the findings of \cite{Farfan2010}. Based on using the MYB for data acquisition recommendations made by Donovan et al. \cite{Donovan2017} regarding the optimal features for low resolution sEMG pattern recognition were taken into consideration. Four so called space domain features of Scaled Mean Absolute Value (SMAV), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Mean Absolute Difference Normalized (MADN), Scaled Mean Absolute Difference Raw (SMADR) were used for feature extraction.   Additionally the well known Hudgins time domain feature Waveform Length (WL) were included \cite{Donovan2017}. These features were chosen in the believes of receiving valuable signal information from both signal amplitude and frequency.
