\section{Feature extraction) 
	
To feed the classifier with training data features were extracted from the signal. The signal were segmented into 200 ms windows with a 50\% overlap respecting the findings of \cite{Farfan2010}. Based on using the MYB for data acquisition recommendations made by Donovan et al. \cite{Donovan2017} regarding the optimal features for low resolution sEMG pattern recognition were taken into consideration. These features proved to provide useful signal information even though the MYB only samples sEMG signals up to 200 Hz, and in this case offering better accuracy than the Hudgins features in a pattern recognition control scheme \cite{Donovan2017}. \\
Four so called space domain (SD) features of Scaled Mean Absolute Value (SMAV), Correlation Coefficient (CC), Mean Absolute Difference Normalized (MADN), Scaled Mean Absolute Difference Raw (SMADR) were used for feature extraction. These features represent some of the presented features Donavan et al. proposed as the rest were left unused due to the intend of reducing feature redundancy. The calculation of SD features lean on the calculation and relation of other SD features. Special for the SD features is utilizing the relation between signals acquired in the different sensors of the MYB, which is used in the feature calculation. Additionally the well known Hudgins time domain feature Waveform Length (WL) were included. \cite{Donovan2017} These features were chosen with the aim of acquiring valuable signal information from both signal amplitude and frequency.
