%\subsection{Subjects}
In this study 16 healthy able-bodied subjects were included (15 male and 1 female - 14 right handed and 2 left handed of mean age 25.3 $\pm$ 1.5). The subjects were recruited by contacting students at Aalborg University. Prior the experiments the subjects received an experiment protocol, containing information on the objective of the study and steps of the experiment. To ensure full understanding and cooperation, the subjects were thoroughly instructed prior the initiation of each step during the experiment. All 16 subjects participated in the entirety of the experiment, from which no data were excluded. The subjects participated voluntarily and received no financial compensation.
