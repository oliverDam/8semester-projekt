Statistics were applied to evaluate improvements in the results obtained in the performance test, user training and data clustering. A Friedmans test was used for multiple comparison and a Tukey-Kramer correction was conducted when detecting an effect. For comparison between groups in each session, a Mann-Whitney U test was applied.
