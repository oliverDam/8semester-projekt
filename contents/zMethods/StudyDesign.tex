The background chapter covered the basic procedures associated with myoelectric prosthetic control and techniques to deal with the proposal of improving users' ability to operate a myoelectric transradial prosthesis by training the user with visual confidence score feedback. This involves descriptions of different hand movements, how the EMG signal is generated and acquired with surface EMG electrodes using the MYB and how the raw EMG signal is processed before it is segmented in windows. Furthermore, it was described how features are extracted from the segmented signal, how the feature values are used in a classification control scheme to distinguish which movement is performed, how linear regression models are used to obtain proportional control, how confidence scores can be calculated as posterior probabilities from the classification scheme, how user training previously has been used to optimize users' ability to operate a myoelectric transradial prosthesis and how the user performance is evaluated. \\
The information acquired in the background section will lay foundation for how the study will be designed, how the procedures will be implemented and which considerations that have been made regarding the implementation. This will be covered in the methods chapter. As the project investigates whether users' ability to operate a myoelectric prosthesis can improve after training with confidence score as visual feedback, a major focus has been put in the implementation of the user training. The chronology of the methods chapter is that the study design will be presented first, after which the implementation of the different procedures will be presented, as the procedures are implemented with regards to how the study design is formed. 

\section{Study Design} \label{sec:M:studyDesign}

This experiment focused on training the user to improve prosthetic control on a classification-based control system. The novel approach in this study was to provide the user with visual feedback on how the system recognized the performed movements during user training, by showing the confidence scores of the movements the control system recognized. The following section will lay an overview of the structure of this experiment. \\
To test if myoelectric prosthetic control could be improved by using visual confidence score feedback the following research hypothesis was made: 
\begin{center}
	\textit{Exposing subjects to user training, in which confidence scores of movement recognition is used as visual feedback, will show statistically significant improvement in performance in a Fitts' Law test compared to a control group receiving label feedback.}
\end{center}


To test the hypothesis 16 subjects of mean age 25.3 $\pm$ 1.48 were recruited: 15 male and 1 female where 14 were right handed and 2 were left handed. Subjects were randomly assigned to either a control group or test group with 8 subjects in each group. The subjects enrolled were assessed to meet inclusion criteria presented in the experimental protocol for test subjects. The experimental protocol was handed out to the test participants before starting the experiment. Subjects in the test group received the experimental protocol containing specific guidance on how to perform the intended user training. The control group as well received the experimental protocol giving guidance on how to perform the user training intended for the control group. The experimental protocol containing both user training guidance schemes can be found in \secref{sec:protocol:experiment}. During the experiment the subject was seated on a chair, with the dominant arm wearing the MYB hanging relaxed laterally down the torso as seen on \figref{fig:experiment_setup} in the experimental protocol. \\
The experiment was designed as a three session investigation. In each session both groups had data acquired, received user training and did a performance test through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed in MATLAB (2017b). During session one it was chosen to add a performance test before exposing the subjects to user training. This preliminary performance test was set to act as a baseline for each group to highlight any initiating group disparity. A graphical illustration of the stages of the study design can be seen on \figref{fig:std}. Essential for the experiment was the difference in user training highlighted in step 3, where the groups received two different types of visual feedback. The test group received a visual feedback of the confidence score the classifier produces, when the subject train the different types of movements. The control group received the same visual training, however this would not inform of the confidence score but instead solely show which movement the classifier thought was being performed. The sections to come will further elaborate on the implementation of each element in the experiment and how the user training differs.
