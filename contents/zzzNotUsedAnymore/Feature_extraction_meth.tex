\section{Feature extraction} 

To obtain the best possible classification, four different features have been extracted from the time-domain (TD) using their respective extraction methods. The features are Mean Absolute Value, Zero crossings, Slope Sign Changes and Waveform length. These will from now on be referred to as MAV, ZC, SSC and WL respectively. This set of features is chosen based on their extensive popularity when used for classification purposes and effect in real-time myoelectric control schemes, along with showing fast computational speeds.\cite{Hudgins1993, Kamavuako2016, Scheme2010}
