%3 user training:  completion rate for total (ding's) contraction level and movement classification
\section{User training results} \label{sec:R:userTraining}
This section will present the results acquired from measurements taken during subjects user training sessions. During user training subjects were instructed to train the performance of the six chosen movements. During this training it were recorded the number of times subjects correctly performed a instructed movement to the contraction interval shown in the training interface. Statistical test were run on this data in a similar fashion as with the Fitts' Law results, described in \secref{sec:R:fitts}.  

\subsection{Total completion rate}
During user training the total completion rate is defined by the number of times a subject correctly performed a movement and held the contraction bar at the given interval until completion. The user training interface is described in \secref{sec:M:usertraining}.
