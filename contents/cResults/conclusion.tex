Based on the results in the experiment it was found that training the user with confidence score feedback compared to single-class feedback can not be linked to any significant difference improvement in performance evaluated through a Fitts' Law test. Furthermore, no significant improvement during a three day training period for either the control or the test group was detected. 

Contrarily, it appears that training the user with single-class feedback can lead to a closer clustering of EMG data compared to training with confidence score feedback. This can be concluded, as a significant improvement was found between the first and last dataset recorded for the control group. To further support this the EMG signal of the subjects who received single-class feedback clustered significantly closer than the test group on the last day of testing.
