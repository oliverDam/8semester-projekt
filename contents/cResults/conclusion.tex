Based on the results of the study it was found that training with uncertainties compared to single-class feedback can not be linked to any change in performance during a Fitts' Law test with all p-values above $0.05$. Furthermore there seems to be no significant improvement during three day training for either the control or the test group. 

On the other hand it appears that training with regular single-class feedback can lead to a closer clustering of EMG data compared to uncertainty feedback. This can be concluded as a significant improvement ($p < 0.05$) was found between the first and last dataset recorded for the control group. To support this the subjects who received single-class feedback clustered significantly closer ($p < 0.05$) than the test group on the last day of testing.
