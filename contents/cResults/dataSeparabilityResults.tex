\section{Data acquisition/separability results}
In this section results from the data acquisition will be presented. The data from the data acquisition is used for training of the system to build the classification control for each individual subject. This data were classified into regions decided by the LDA classifier used as control scheme in this project. For each region there is a class consisting of a cluster of data points. In this section these clusters are analysed by use of PCA, described in \secref{sec:BG:dataSeparability}. With PCA the separability and density of data clusters can be evaluated.
