User training is an important part of overcoming the challenge of making prosthetic limbs more functional, as the systems depend on the user generating the same distinguishable muscle patterns when using the prosthesis, and different methods can be used when teaching users to perform specific movements. \cite{Powel2014} This study aims to investigate whether uncertainty feedback in training can improve the users ability to complete a classification based target reaching test in an interactive GUI compared to a control group receiving single class feedback. The study will be designed to examine this in lower arm prosthetics.

16 able-bodied subjects were recruited for the study, where they were instructed to perform six different hand movements in three intensities during data acquisition. This was then used to build a LDA based classifier the subjects were to use during the training teaching them to perform specific movements at different intensities. Afterwards they were subjected to a Fitts' Law based test in a GUI to examine their ability to control the system. This was done for three sessions to test their development during training.

The results showed no significant difference between the two groups and no improvement over the three sessions for either of the groups. There was no difference in the performance during training as well. A significant improvement in cluster density was found in the control group, where the third session resulted in more dense clusters both compared to the first session and to the test group.
