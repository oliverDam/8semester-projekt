A possible way to increase accurate control is to include a probability/uncertainty estimation of movements. This can be achieved by combining regression and classification methods into one control scheme. (linear regression and LDA)

This study investigate the effect of implementing uncertainty estimation and probability of desired movements, when using linear regression as control scheme.
