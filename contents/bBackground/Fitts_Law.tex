In aiding the quantification of the two proposed control measures, a Fitts' law test will be used. A general Fitts' law test incorporates five different performance metrics in the evaluation of movement.\cite{Kamavuako2014,Scheme2013} The five metrics and their description can be found in table \ref{fig:Fitts}
