\section{Anatomy of the distal part of the arm} \label{sec:anatomy}


In this project EMG recordings will be measured from the distal forearm of test subjects, in order to use EMG signals for control and test the effect of providing feedback during user training. Recordings will be recorded with a Myo armband (MYB) from Thalmic Labs, further described in \secref{sec:MYB}. This section will provide information on the anatomy of the distal part of the arm and the general muscles involved in movements used in this project.\\
The human arm is the base and extender for our greatest tool: the hand. The human hand is a very versatile and dexterous tool, and the loss of that function is therefore a great loss in relation to functionality and independence. The hand gains its vast utilization by having 27 degrees of freedom (DOF). This in itself makes it very dexterous but it is the arm that moves the hand along seven DOFs, that enables the hand to use its dexterity.\\
Movement of limbs are caused by muscle contractions. The muscles contract when receiving nerve impulses from the central nervous system (CNS). \cite{Martini2012} \\
The greater workings of muscle activation is described further in \secref{sec:EMG}. This project will use six movements for control of a virtual interface and visual feedback. The movements are flexion and extension, ulnar and radial deviation of the wrist, and open and close hand. The movements are visualised on \figref{fig:wristMovement}. These six movements cover three DOFs.

Many muscles in the lower forearm are involved when performing hand gestures. Several muscles are actors in performing specific movements, and some of these are at times antagonistic muscles but will work together when performing other movements. The flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis brevis muscles are as an example antagonists in performing flexion and extension at the wrist, but are both involved when doing abduction of the wrist. \cite{Martini2012} This can prove a problem when recording EMG signals from these muscles, since if based only on the recording there is no way of knowing which muscle and under which movement the signal is recorded from. However, this problem is overcome when doing EMG recordings of several muscles at the same time. As with the MYB, recordings are made in a circle all the way around one section of the forearm, providing a recording of several muscles at the same time. This enables a control system to evaluate individual muscle recordings in relation the recordings of other muscles, thus making correct classification of different hand gestures possible. \cite{Mendez2017}


%Looking closer at the anatomy and arrangement of the muscles involved in performing these four movements, several of the muscles are active during movements in both DOFs. As noted on \figref{fig:lowerArm} a total of five muscles in the distal part of the forearm are activated during both flexion/extension and ulnar/radial deviation at the wrist. However, according to \cite{Mendez2017} et. al the MYB has no problem correctly classifying different hand gestures, even when the active muscles are anatomically overlapping. %maybe more
